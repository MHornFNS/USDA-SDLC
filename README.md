# USDA-SDLC

This page details the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) systems development lifecycle (SDLC). This process is used for all USDA FNS Office of Information Technology (OIT) projects related to information system and application development, developed either contractually or in-house. The SDLC is applicable across all FNS environments (e.g., workstation, server, mobile, etc.). The SDLC guides the process for custom software development projects and requires various documents and deliverables for each phase. It is the Information Technology (IT) business process for the delivery of custom software development projects. The SDLC provides a structure and set of governance for FNS software development efforts. It provides the guidance required to ensure predictability and consistency across software development projects. The FNS SDLC framework allows for tailoring of the process to include customizing, waiving or combining particular SDLC phases, activities, deliverables or project reviews based on the specific project requirements or specific business needs. For more detailed information, refer to the SDLC Guide. Please refer to this page on details on how to submit a project request. Once the project request is submitted, OIT will work with the business users to determine which SDLC process - a) Hybrid Agile Scrum b) Non-SDLC c) Waterfall fits the best. 

Hybrid Agile Scrum SDLC 

The Hybrid Agile Scrum approach follows the eight phases shown in the Waterfall method, but it replaces the Requirements Gathering & Analysis phase with Sprint Zero and combines the Design, Development, Integration & Testing phases into one phase with one or more iterative Sprints. The purpose of the Hybrid Agile Scrum approach is to use an iterative approach to perform planning, requirements, analysis, design, development and testing phases. It does not replace these phases, but performs them in short iterations. The Hybrid Agile Scrum approach guides the process for agile software development projects and requires various documents and deliverables. FNS allows freedom for incorporating agile associated industry-leading practices; however, requests a minimum structure to ensure consistency and predictability across projects.
